    echo"<h1>About Me</h1><hr/>";
    echo"<h2>Obajimi</h2>";
    echo"<p> My full name is Emmanuel Obajimi Macaulay. I am a graduate of biochemistry from the university of lagos.
    I graduated in 2018 and completed my NYSC mandatory service in march 2020. My hobbies are reading, coding, playing musical instruments and so on.
    <br>
    I started programming in 2017 when a mentor approached me with the concept of programming. He assisted me with materials and resources.
    I was busy with school so I could not follow up. I was able to learn python basics through codeacademy.
    After I gradauated from the university I decided to pickup programming again and enrolled for codeLagos 2018. 
    I was able to learn basics of Java, HTML & CSS. I had to go for service, so after my service year, I tried picking up programming again.
    <br>
    Thanks to the lockdown(covid-19 Lockdown), I was able to engage in programming via the GADS 2020(Google Android Developers) programme.
    I chose the Android Track and this has helped me apply and sharpen my java knowledge and introduced me to android programming.
    <br>
    I also joined the Hamoye Data science internship which turned out to be quite advanced for me but it forced me to dust my python
    and pickup new data science skills(data wrangling, python libraries for data science;(pandas, numpy,scikitLearn and so on), 
    regression in machine learning, classification in machine learning, deep learning etc.).
    <br>
    After the lockdown, and due to my rapid exposure to advanced programming concepts and applications as witnessed in the GADS and Hamoye Internship,
    I decided to get grounded in the basics, so I enrolled in a programming school(Univelcity) and opted for Back-end web development with Python/Django. 
    I'm also partaking in the sidehustle Internship where I'm learning website development & UI/UX design.
